# üì± Sentiment Analysis on Jumia Smartphones Under KES‚ÄØ10,000

An end-to-end data science project that scrapes, processes, and analyzes Jumia customer reviews for budget smartphones (‚â§ KES‚ÄØ10,000), combining web scraping, SQL storage, NLP preprocessing, topic modeling, and machine learning.

---

## üéØ Project Overview

- **Objective**: Scrape smartphone reviews from Jumia, store them in a database, and apply NLP and ML to uncover customer sentiments and trending themes.
- **Dataset**: Reviews, star ratings, product metadata from Jumia smartphones priced under KES 10,000.
- **Outcomes**:
  - Sentiment distribution breakdown (positive, neutral, negative)
  - Insights into battery life, camera, pricing issues
  - Topic modeling to identify key review themes
  - Evaluation of multiple sentiment models (TextBlob, VADER, RoBERTa)
  - ML classification to detect negative sentiments with high recall

## üîÑ Project Workflow

1. **Data Extraction**
   - `scraping.py`: Scrapy spider extracts smartphone URLs.
   - Dynamic review loading handled with Selenium.
   - Output stored as `page_source.html` and into `jumia_data.db`.

2. **Data Storage**
   - SQLite DB with tables for reviews and product metadata.

3. **Data Preprocessing & Sentiment Scoring**
   - `sentiment_analyser.ipynb`: pipeline to clean text, tokenize, and lemmatize.
   - Generates sentiment scores with TextBlob, VADER, and RoBERTa.
   - Analyzes mismatches (12.5%) between sentiment vs. star ratings.

4. **Topic Modeling**
   - Visualized in `lda_visualization.html`, identifying 3 core review themes.

5. **Feature Engineering & ML Modeling**
   - Converts text to TF-IDF features.
   - Trains and compares Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, Balanced SVM, and SMOTE-enhanced SVM.
   - Evaluates models based on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## üìà Key Findings

- ~70% of reviews were positive, 22% negative, 8% neutral.
- Battery life, charging time, camera quality, and pricing were prominent discussion topics.
- RoBERTa showed the strongest agreement (65.6%) with star ratings.
- Nokia models had the most polarized sentiments; Itel phones were most reviewed within the price range.
- Balanced SVM prioritized negative review recall, key for detecting customer issues.

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Challenges

- **Class imbalance** made negative sentiment detection tricky.
- Misuse of star ratings and sarcasm affected sentiment alignment.
- SMOTE skewed model bias toward minority classes.

---

## üöÄ Next Steps

- Extend scraping to other platforms (e.g., Kilimall) to compare sentiment across marketplaces.
- Broaden category scope (e.g., tablets, accessories).
- Collect more data to improve training and class balance.
- Explore advanced NLP models (fine-tuned BERT/RoBERTa) for sentiment nuance.
